    From grandad Renzo's love for the earth and dad Pietro's passion, now is Massimo that takes care of the <br />
    6 hectars of vineyard that spans between the villages of Sala Monferrato and Ozzano Monferrato, <br />
    both Unesco Heritage from 2015 among the vineyard landscapes of Langhe Roero and Monferrato.<br/>
    Our farm produces various wines, from classics: Barbera del Monferrato DOC, Monferrato Freisa DOC, <br/>
    Grignolino del Monferrato Casalese DOC, Monferrato Dolcetto, Monferrato Freisa to whites, rosè, red wines. <br/><br/>
    Our excellences are:<br />
    the “Barbera del Monferrato Superiore DOCG” refined in oak barrels for 11 months;<br/>
    the “Monferrato Rosso Notu”, grandad's wine, a barbera made from premium grapes from an old vineyard from 1923. <br/>
    We wanted, with the label, to dedicate this wine to Notu, great-great-grandad founder of our winery; for this reason his face is on the label.<br/>
    “Lo sfizioso” a particular wine you can tell from the name (delicious). In an old vineyard bought by friars was found aleatico vines, <br/>
    usually found in Isola d'Elba or Puglia. The plants where multiplied by buds until we had enough for a cultivated surface of an hectar <br/>
    from which we obtain this brightly colored wine, with perfumes and flavours strong and fruity, refined in oak barrels for 3 months;<br/>
    finally a particular wine from red raisins: “La coccinella”, produced with traditional methods; we harvest grapes in late November, <br/>
    place them on grids in the barn having the patience to remove every week the bad grapes, until in January we have them pressed and then fermented<br/>
    for 10 month. The name recalls the various bugs you can find in the vineyard thanks to lack of herbicides.";
